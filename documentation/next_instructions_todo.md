# Gemini - Next Instructions

Hello! This file contains instructions to get you up to speed on the Moodle deployment project. Please follow these prompts in order.

**Prompt 1: Understand the Project**
"Hello. Please read all the markdown files in the `documentation/` directory to familiarize yourself with the project goals and the new, high-performance installation setup."

**Prompt 2: Review the Deployment Plan**
"I have a deployment script named `deploy.sh`. Please read this script to understand the deployment steps, variables, and configurations."

**Prompt 3: Verify Server Environment**
"Now, verify that the server environment matches the requirements for the `deploy.sh` script. Check the operating system version (should be Ubuntu 24.04) and check if Docker, Docker Compose, and Git are installed. If they are not installed, please install them as a first step."

**Prompt 4: Execute the Deployment**
"The server is ready. Please now execute the deployment script located at `./deploy.sh` and guide me through any manual steps it requires."
