### Session 2025-09-12

**Goal:** Troubleshoot and optimize the local Moodle development environment, then prepare for VPS deployment.

**Summary of Actions:**

1.  **Initial Diagnosis:** Identified that the initial "slowness" was caused by an incomplete Moodle installation, leading to database errors.
2.  **First Installation (Bind Mount):** Successfully installed Moodle in the initial environment by:
    *   Creating and configuring `config.php`.
    *   Running the Moodle CLI installer.
    *   Troubleshooting and fixing database connection errors, file permission errors, and a reverse-proxy redirect loop (`ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS`).
3.  **Performance Investigation:** After a successful install, diagnosed the remaining sluggishness. Ran comparative benchmarks that proved the database connection was fast, and the performance bottleneck was the filesystem I/O overhead from using Docker bind mounts on Windows.
4.  **Migration to Named Volumes:** To solve the performance bottleneck, migrated the entire environment to a high-performance named-volume setup.
    *   Modified `php/Dockerfile` to copy the Moodle source code directly into the image.
    *   Modified `docker-compose.yml` to use named volumes (`moodle-code`, `moodledata`) instead of bind mounts.
    *   Rebuilt the Docker image and successfully re-installed Moodle in the new, high-performance environment.
5.  **Git & Deployment Preparation:**
    *   Initialized a local Git repository.
    *   Created a `.gitignore` file tailored for Moodle.
    *   Pushed the entire project to a new remote repository on GitHub.
    *   Authored a comprehensive deployment script (`deploy.sh`) for the target VPS (Ubuntu 24.04).
    *   Updated project documentation (`installation.md`, `configuration.md`) to reflect the new setup.
    *   Created `next_instructions_todo.md` to bootstrap future sessions.
    *   Organized all scripts and notes into the `documentation` folder.

**Next Steps:**

*   The user will manually install the Gemini CLI on the VPS.
*   The user will upload the `documentation` folder (containing `deploy.sh` and `next_instructions_todo.md`) to the VPS.
*   The user will start a new session on the VPS and use the `next_instructions_todo.md` file to guide the new instance in deploying the project.
